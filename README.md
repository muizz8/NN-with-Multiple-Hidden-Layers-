# NN with Multiple Hidden Layers 🤖

This repository demonstrates how to build, train, and analyze a neural network with multiple hidden layers using PyTorch. The notebook is structured to guide users through key stages of the process, from data preparation to model training and evaluation.

## Features ✨
- 📊 **Visualization**: Plot and visualize data and results.
- 📈 **Data Generation**: Create synthetic datasets for training.
- 🤖 **Model Building**: Design neural networks using `torch.nn.Module` and `nn.Sequential`.
- 🎯 **Training**: Train the model with defined loss functions and optimizers.
- 📋 **Practice Section**: Experiment with `nn.Sequential` for rapid prototyping.

## Libraries Used 📚
- **PyTorch** (`torch`, `torch.nn`, `torch.nn.functional`, `torch.utils.data`) 🤖
- **NumPy** (`numpy`) 📊
- **Matplotlib** (`matplotlib.pyplot`) 📈
